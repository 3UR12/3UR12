## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently focused on **backend development** using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.  
I enjoy creating apps and tools that solve real problems — from finance trackers to task automation.  

I'm also familiar with full-stack fundamentals and interested in web APIs, software design, and deployment.
